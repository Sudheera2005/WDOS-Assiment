## Dynamic Gaming Shop Website (Frontend)

This repository contains a dynamic web development project created to learn and practice core frontend concepts.  
The project was developed as part of an assignment and simulates a **gaming shop** interface.

The frontend was built using **HTML and JavaScript**, with **JSON** used to manage product data.  
Client-side storage is handled using **browser localStorage**, allowing cart data to persist across sessions without a backend.

### Technologies Used

- JSON
- Browser localStorage

### Key Features
- Dynamic product listing from JSON data
- Add-to-cart functionality
- Cart data persistence using localStorage
- Basic DOM manipulation and event handling
- Client-side logic without backend integration

### Learning Objectives
- Understanding dynamic web development concepts

- Using localStorage for state persistence
- Implementing basic cart logic using JavaScript

### Purpose
This project was built as part of a web development assignment to strengthen foundational frontend and JavaScript concepts.
